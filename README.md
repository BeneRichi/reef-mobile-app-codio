# Reef Chain Mobile App

Use the Reef Chain on your smartphone with the Reef Mobile App based on [Flutter framework](https://flutter.dev/).

## Getting Started

For developing the app you will need to do certain steps:

1. Fork/Clone [@reef-defi/reef-mobile-app](git@github.com:reef-defi/reef-mobile-app.git).
2. Run `flutter run`. For any issues use `flutter doctor`.

Note: Js libraries are used for interaction with Reef chain inside "lib/js/packages/reef-mobile-js" directory. 

1. Install dependencies: running `yarn` in "lib/js" directory. 
2. Run `yarn start`.

Mobx is used for Flutter state management. For updating its classes do following:
1. Run `flutter pub run build_runner watch`

üåç Internationalization : This app uses the Internationalization library to provide support for multiple languages. To use this library, you will need to run the following command "flutter gen-l10n"

This will generate the necessary localization files for your app. You can then add your own translations to these files to make your app accessible to users in different countries and regions. The location is "/lib/l10n" , it contains key value pairs. 

Nomenclature : app_<language_code>.arb
